## üìå Abstract
PhysioTrack is an intelligent, integrated system designed to improve the home rehabilitation experience for knee injury patients through accurate monitoring, interactivity, and motivation. Statistics show that nearly 50% of patients struggle with adhering to home exercise routines, and over 70% of knee injuries require consistent physiotherapy. Additionally, more than 60% of patients face psychological challenges such as anxiety or depression during recovery.  

The system uses IMU and pressure sensors to track movements in real time, with AI providing instant audio feedback for correction. Through virtual reality, patients engage with a virtual trainer in a gym-like environment. To boost motivation and mental well-being, users earn points to customize a virtual character, making therapy both effective and engaging.
